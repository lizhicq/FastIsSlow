      "\n",
      "- Demonstrable Insights on Risk Management: Hannah demonstrated her critical thinking skills by delving into risks associated with Live CTR drop Week over Week (WoW), specifically within the L6 Creator group or Grocery assortment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Lack of Details in SOP Implementation: While Hannah successfully streamlined processes through automation and SOP implementation, the specific details about which processes were automated and what the SOPs were are missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Dependency on Certain Areas for Performance: A significant portion of Hannah’s identified strengths seem to be associated with a particular project level or type like the Hero project or Grocery assortment. Hence, her abilities and contributions might not be as profound if such favourable conditions are lacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Unclear Impact on Actual Performance Metrics: Despite contributing to an improved Live Efficiency of creators, it's unclear how this has affected actual performance metrics across the board. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Limited Data Interpretation: While she identified potential risks with the Live CTR drop in specific groups, Hannah's review didn't demonstrate her actions to mitigate these risks or how she used these insights to improve overall strategies.\n",
      "==========Feedback for Jennie.rtf=============:\n",
      "Strengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Impressive Data Analysis and Strategy: Jennie has a knack for identifying key performance indicators and working on strategies that drive growth. For example, her work in Q1-Q4 showed a steady increase in go-live creators which was due to her strategic approach to achieving 100%+ activeness OKR completion.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Initiative in Launching New Projects: Jennie's initiative in launching and piloting new projects like the assorted strategies and longtail creator campaigns has evidently contributed to the overall performance. The campaign she launched with the creator campaign team achieved and even surpassed the target.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Effective Teamwork and Communication: Her collaborative efforts with SEA education and MCN teams show her ability to work in a cross-functional team. Her integrated campaign resources and shared workshops enhanced productivity and increased the publish rate post sharing session.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Strong Focus on Long-Term Impact: Jennie’s work on breaking even creator supply and focusing on long-term impacts shows an excellent strategic perspective. It's evident in the increase of daily breakeven supply by 139%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Limited Focus on Short-Term Goals: While Jennie is commendable in her attention to long-term growth, it might be necessary to pay equal attention to immediate, short-term objectives. Immediate benefits might be lost in the singular focus on long-term ROI strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Balancing Creativity and Data-Driven Approach: Jennie has shown remarkable ability in understanding data and translating it into actionable strategies. However, there may be room to integrate more creativity and innovative ideas into her work.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Need to Streamline Responsibilities: The diverse projects Jennie is involved in is praiseful but also could lead to overextension. While diverse experience is positive, it would be beneficial for Jennie to focus on core responsibilities to avoid spreading herself too thin. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Difficulties in Prioritization: Given the various responsibilities and roles Jennie adopts, there may be a risk of losing sight of key priorities. A case could be the introduction of diverse workshop topics, which, while a good initiative, might have deviated from her core duties.\n",
      "==========Feedback for Elly.rtf=============:\n",
      "Strengths:\n",
      "- Leadership Skills: The report reveals strong leadership skills displayed through managing a diverse team and prioritizing team expansion. Delegating key projects to team members for their growth indicates a trust-based leadership style.\n",
      "- Efficiency and Planning: Successfully devised comprehensive policies for subsidy and budget management. The observed efficient budget usage rate and the strategic allocation of funds showcases effective planning and efficiency.\n",
      "- Creativity and Innovation: Innovative counter strategies for competing brands and the demonstrated ability to pioneer significant uplift within the Hero and Semi pools reflect a high level of creativity and innovation.\n",
      "- Collaboration: Exhibited excellent cross-functional collaboration with Internal Top Creator, Creator Growth team, and several other teams to align strategic goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses:\n",
      "- Budget Management: There is room for improvement in budget management, especially in providing adequate funds to the Grocery category and optimizing budget allocation of the Priority package. The slow budget expense of the Priority package is a challenge that needs addressing.\n",
      "- Policy Revision: The contributor could revise the policies that have started to lose effectiveness over time. For example, the GMV contribution from KA Daily looks like it diminished over the last quarter. \n",
      "- Creator Engagement: Engagement with lower-tier creators could be amplified more, especially considering the success of the Diligence package. \n",
      "- Response to Variable Performance: The contributor needs to respond to variable performance of the team more effectively. For example, improvement in handling underwhelming performance of a promotion due to a mismatch between the scale of investment and the actual engagement creator (EC) capacity could be made.\n",
      "==========Feedback for Diem.rtf=============:\n",
      "Strengths:\n",
      "- Analytical Skill: Excelled in providing analytical consulting service, identifying key business opportunities and challenges through data analysis. \n",

      "- Collaboration Skill: Demonstrated excellent collaborativeness in co-owning the OKRs with the teams they worked with and in joining day-to-day operations to optimize workloads. \n",
      "    Their work as a Creator Growth & Education strategist, and Creator Campaign strategist stands out in this aspect.\n",
      "- Proactiveness: Actively sought out operational problems and opportunities. One noteworthy case is their diagnosis and recommendations for increasing creators' task penetration and completion rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses:\n",
      "- Detail-oriented: Although their comprehensive data analysis and recommendations are commendable, there is a tendency to delve deeply into data details that might sometimes make their reports and presentations overly complex. \n",
      "    For example, their performance data presentation might have been easier to digest if it was presented with more concise and high-level summaries.\n",
      "- Time Management: Due to the wide range of projects they're handling, they might be spreading themselves too thin at times, which could potentially affect the quality of their work or cause delays. \n",
      "    A case in point is their responsibility in tracking budget & policy data, supporting another team's data needs, and conducting training, all while performing their own role strategies.\n",
      "- Communication: While their performance in collaboration is notable, they might need to work on articulating their ideas and strategies more clearly to gain faster and better alignment from teams. Taking a simpler and straightforward approach can help in this.\n",
      "- Adaptability: They might need to be more adaptable and flexible, especially in terms of swiftly adjusting their analytical practices and strategies based on evolving business needs and trends.\n",
      "==========Feedback for Nico.rtf=============:\n",
      "Strengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Excellent GMV Increase: Nico managed to significantly uplift the GMV contribution from Q1 to Q4, standing out with a leap from 18M to 54M. These numbers show the effectiveness of Nico's strategies in enhancing the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Stellar Collaboration: Nico’s collaborations with team members and outside parties like the LT team and strategists have yielded high results. The Hero Project Contribution and work with Creator Campaign team stand out as excellent examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Impressive Creator Management: Nico has shown capacity in expanding the creator pool and improving the quality of content supply. Growth in numbers of active creators, as well as improvement in live show and video Gross Profit Margin, underlines Nico's effective management.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Effective Seller Interaction: Nico's dealings with KA brands and the success of the Matching Practice exhibit successful collaboration and negotiation skills. Cases like Club De Nuit and Denis support this.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Great Team Management: The ability to revise team structure swiftly and aligning them with new projects demonstrates leadership skills and promotes team growth and performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ambiguous Planning: Despite the overall success, some parts of the report, for example, the section about \"Hero Project Contribution,\" have vague language, making it hard to understand the exact planning process.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Financial Management: The figures related to subsidy rates and target achievement rates aren't consistent throughout (e.g., in Q2, HB's attainment rate was below target while in Q3, both rates exceeded expectations). This inconsistency might suggest a potential need for improvement in financial management and prediction capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Lack of Detailed Strategy Representation: The report doesn’t comprehensively reflect any major roadblocks faced and the strategies devised to overcome those.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Intern Conversion Rate: Only two out of six interns were converted to full-time employees. This might suggest a need for better orientation and training for interns.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Performance Metric: Although the GMV data is highlighted prominently in this report, there is no sufficient context or comparison to industry standards or previous performance statistics. This makes it difficult to measure the actual impact of Nico's work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Nico has shown substantial strengths in terms of enhancing business performance and promoting effective collaboration. However, improvements can be made in financial management and strategic planning.\n",
      "==========Feedback for nam.rtf=============:\n",
      "Strengths:\n",
      "- Excellent strategizing and planning skills: The person displayed strong strategic planning skills through the successful handling of the key livestream sessions for the assortment and promotional tool strategy.\n",

      "\n",
      "Weaknesses:\n",
      "- Could use better orchestration of strategies: While the delivery of Ka Solution and product assortment projects is commendable, it would be more beneficial if strategies were better orchestrated, ensuring seamless processes and clearer communication.\n",
      "- Room for growth in achieving targets: Despite significant product sales growth in Q4, hitting the full target should be a priority. A thorough evaluation of strategies to determine why targets were missed is suggested.\n",
      "- Could benefit from enhancing initiative: Although the initiative on projects such as the Product Hero is commendable, more proactivity in spearheading projects and strategies could help in driving more growth in the future.\n",
      "- Potentially improve on partnership building: While the person was able to establish connections with numerous brands through affiliate solution packages, further effort could be made to strengthen and expand these partnerships to facilitate more successful future collaborations.\n",
      "- May need to focus on diversification: While the primary focus on FA&HB creators paid off, exploring and tapping into other categories could bring about diversified and potentially larger returns.\n",
      "==========Feedback for jamie.rtf=============:\n",
      "Strengths:\n",
      "- Project Management: Jamie has executed an impressive array of projects over the past year. From creator tasks planning and optimization, to managing the subsidy incentive packages and ensuring ecosystem growth, Jamie's ability to handle multiple projects simultaneously is commendable. His work has led to significant growth, with subsidy rate, GMV, the number of creators covered by the policies, and #level of creators within the ecosystem all showing significant increases across multiple quarters.\n",
      "- Strategic Planning: The strategic planning in creating creator task roadmaps and optimizing task funnel metrics was commendable. The Task funnel mechanism developed by Jamie led to better task coverage and enhanced growth. The number of completed creator tasks and activeness growth showed distinct improvement.\n",

      "- Precision and Detailing: While the overall execution of projects and strategies is commendable, more focus is needed on ensuring precision in the data shared.
