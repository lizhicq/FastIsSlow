市场的投资风格分为在三种类型。我更偏好第三种投资风格，但是也希望尝试第一和第二种投资风格。意识大角度知道他好。投身到大趋势之中，核心是把握宏观，把握牛熊，参与到风格牛市之中，这种把握能力最难得，要求最全面，需要多因素多变量判断，但回报也最高最快。难点在于稳定，因为银子和变量都太多了。二是别人不知道它好但你知道，或者是别人都知道它好但你知道其实更好。哲学要对个股有深入的研究，通常是专业人士，资深的基金经理等，这种能力需要累积和机缘，回报高且效率也不低。难点在于积累与机缘都是高门槛，且很难重复，毕竟你懂这家公司不代表也能懂另一家。三是大家都不知道它好的。你不知道我也不知道，但是大家都不知道它好，所以它就没有相应的定价，如果还是不好，那也亏不了多少钱，而且湾一号了却可以挣到不少。这种方式从整体上看回报不高且效率最低，好处就是没有门槛，只要把心气放平就可以了，完全是一个碰运气的体系。如果这是一个经常会发生变化和有意外发生的增量世界，那这种方式会比较容易有意外之财，如果是一个固化的存量环境，就会很沉闷且没有惊喜，而如果是一个减量的环境呢，那就会有点危险。
The market is divided into three types of investment styles. I prefer the third style of investment, but also want to try the first and second style of investment. Awareness of the big perspective know he good. Committed to the general trend, the core is to grasp the macro, grasp the bulls and bears, participate in the style bull market, this grasp ability is the most rare, requires the most comprehensive, requires multi-factor multi-variable judgment, but also the highest and fastest returns. The difficulty is stability, because the silver and variables are too much.The second is that others do not know it is good but you know, or others know it is good but you know it is actually better. Philosophy to have in-depth research on individual stocks, usually professionals, senior fund managers, etc., this ability requires accumulation and chance, high returns and efficiency is not low. The difficulty is that accumulation and chance are high threshold, and it is difficult to repeat, after all, you know this company does not mean that you can also know another.The third is that everyone does not know it well. You do not know I do not know, but everyone does not know that it is good, so it is not priced accordingly, if it is still bad, it is not much money to lose, and Bay One up but can earn a lot. This way from the overall return is not high and the least efficient, the benefit is that there is no threshold, as long as the heart is flat, it is completely a system of chance. If this is an incremental world that often changes and has accidents, then this way will be easier to have a windfall, if it is a solidified stock environment, it will be very dull and no surprises, and if it is a decreasing environment it, it will be a bit dangerous.
